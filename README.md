# BDLite - VR Optimized
This project is a fork of [BDLite by davidxn](https://github.com/davidxn/BDLite). See the BDLite home page at http://teamouse.net/games/doom/bdlite/

BDLite is a stripped-down version of Brutal Doom that retains some of the graphical enhancements and modified enemy/weapon behavior while providing gameplay that more closely resembles vanilla Doom. In its original form, BDLite can cause performance issues on standalone VR headsets such as Meta Quest and Quest 2 (running on QuestZDoom). This optimized version eliminates some effects that contributed to reduced framerate and helps the mod to run better on standalone VR HMDs.

License information isn't explicitly contained in the original repo, but the readme states that it is intended for "mod authors to build on top of it," so this fork was created in that spirit.

All credit for sprites / effects / behavior goes to the original authors as described in pk3/CREDITS.txt.
