# BDLite - VR Optimized
BDLite is a stripped-down version of Brutal Doom that retains some of the graphical enhancements and modified enemy/weapon behavior while providing gameplay that more closely resembles vanilla Doom. In its original form, it can be taxing on standalone VR headsets such as Meta Quest and Quest 2 (running on QuestZDoom). This version attempts to maintain as much of the original as possible while eliminating some things that drive down framerate.
