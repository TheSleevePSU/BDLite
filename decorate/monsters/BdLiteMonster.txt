/*

BdLiteMonster class!

A BdLiteMonster needs:

	The normal Doom monster stuff: Spawn, See, Missile/Melee, etc.
	On death, monster jumps to Death.[damage type]
	Each of these should have no animation, just set the flags needed to declare the monster dead, then jump to one of a random set of appropriate Die states
	The Die state should spawn any blood/gib actors, play the death animation and hold the monster in a -1 state (or remove it if it's particularly serious).
	
	The damage types are!
	
	* Kick (covers all close range damage)
	* SuperKick (berserk damage)
	* Bullet
	* Shotgun
	* RapidFire
	* Explosive
	* Plasma
	* Flak
