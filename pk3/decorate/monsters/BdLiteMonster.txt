/**BdLiteMonster class!

A BdLiteMonster needs:

	The normal Doom monster stuff: Spawn, See, Missile/Melee, etc.
	On death, monster jumps to Death.[damage type]
	Each of these should have no animation, just set the flags needed to declare the monster dead, then jump to one of a random set of appropriate Die states
	The Die state should spawn any blood/gib actors, play the death animation and hold the monster in a -1 state (or remove it if the death is particularly serious).
	
	The damage types from the player are:
	
	* Kick (covers all close range damage)
	* SuperKick (berserk damage)
	* Bullet (Slow firing bullets)
	* Shotgun (Scatter weapons like shotgun)
	* RapidFire (Rapid fire tearing weapons)
	* Explosive (Rockets, grenades)
	* Plasma (Plasma and laser weapons)
	* Flak (Big scatter weapons like the SSG) */
